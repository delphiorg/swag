# SWAG
This a snapshot from what I published in 2001... Maybe I will revisit it again.

Welcome to the HTML version of SWAG [SourceWare Archive Group](https://web.archive.org/web/20020722092859/http://gdsoft.com/swag/). This is an HTML version of the last SWAG release from **11/29/1997**. 
No new content has been added. At this point it is static, but at some future point it may be reborn in some new form. Also, there is no search engine yet, but one may be forth comming.

> "SWAG is a collection of source code and program examples for the PASCAL programming language. The material has been donated by various PASCAL programmers from around the world,
> who desire to contribute to the advancement of one of the greatest programming languages there is. SWAG packets are available in 57 different categories covering EVERY aspect of
> the PASCAL language, and ALL ABSOLUTELY FREE !!! ... The material contained in SWAG is intended to be a teaching and learning aid for users of the PASCAL language.
> Whether you are a beginner or experienced programmer, you'll find SWAG to be an invaluable source of ideas and information. " - [gdsoft via Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20020722092859/http://gdsoft.com/swag/about_swag.html)

Why a site with code mostly from pre-Windows 95 era Turbo Pascal programming? There are a few reasons. 
The first is Nostalgia - for anyone who programmed in this time period the SWAG was an invaluable resource. 
Another reason is that most of this stuff is still very useful in new programming challenges. For example, calculating check-sums or sorting data is still done pretty much the same way. 
And there is even a section on Borland Delphi (Mostly version 1 and maybe some 2). 
There is also a lot ot be learned from this code written back when concerns dealt with fitting your entire program on a 1.2 meg floppy, running in 64K memory block sizes and on slower CPU's. 
Learning from these examples of efficiency illustrated here can only result in better performance in our programs today.

The Pascal language is alive and well today, with products like - my favorites- Delphi & Free Pascal, but also Turbo Pascal, Pocket Studio, Irie Pascal, and GPC in use making great programs. 
So grab a compiler (if you don't already have one) browse through the snippets and start programming.

The code snippets on these pages are generally freeware or public domain as defined by their accompanying comments and copyrights. 
Gayle Davis, the original keeper of the SWAG, has given his blessing to this porting.
