TITLE    : KOJAKVGA 3.1 (486 ENHANCED)

FILENAME : KOJAKVGA.PAS

AUTHOR   : SCOTT TUNSTALL (aka Lt. Kojak)

FINISH   : 18TH AUGUST 1996.. AND
DATE       29TH AUGUST 1996 - (That was something else which
	   finished - so sad!)


	   DISTRIBUTE FREELY TO YOUR WORST ENEMIES :)

****************************************************************

&quot;Thanks to all who contacted me regarding games programming
	and especially to Susan Smith who's been a great help over
	the past couple of months.
	Also to Kenny who's done some of the graphic work (like the
	intro screens to all my games)&quot;

DISCLAIMER
----------

Use this unit at your OWN RISK. I take NO responsibility if it
kills or crashes your system. This unit works fine on my machine.

Distribute this code if you like.. make sure the code &amp; comments
are intact. if you write any software with this unit (or parts
from it) you are required to mention my name and KojakVGA V3 in
the credits.




ABOUT KOJAKVGA
--------------

I may have posted an earlier, crapper version of KOJAKVGA to
Gayle. Version 3.1 (This version) is where the action's at!
Use this version!

NEWGRAPH was my last attempt at a complete graphics unit. I had
been working on it from 1994-95 and had intended to release it
as shareware (if I knew about beerware back then... ;) )
but found that it lacked more serious functions and so I sent
it to the SWAG in June 96.

Over a 3 month period I altered NEWGRAPH beyond recognition,
removing minor bugs, optimising code and adding seriously cool
functions. I must be mad!!!

Let's just say KOJAKVGA kicks NEWGRAPH's ass all over the place.
And you're getting it FREE! What more could you ask for?



WHAT'S NEW THEN SCOTT?
----------------------


4 direction scrolling, Shape mirroring &amp; scaling, faster
routines, more validation and enhanced notes. Is that enough? :)

NO?!!!

UPDATES
-------

Can't see an update to KOJAKVGA for some time. However, I am
considering using linear addressing (longints instead of pointers)
to allow XMS memory to be accessed for sprites, playfields etc.

MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------

o Turbo Pascal 6. However, KojakVGA was created with TP7,
  so you may need to remove some of the switches below if
  compiling with TP6.

o 486 processor. The previous versions (NEWGRAPH and KOJAKVGA v2)
  worked on a 386, but were intended to be used with a 486
  (does anyone use 386's now for games? ;) )


o VGA graphics card that supports mode 13h and the 262,144
  colour palette. And my 640 x 480 x 16.7m colour
  VESA unit (based on this) will blow your mind... I think ;)
