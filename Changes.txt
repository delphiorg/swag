Okay, here are the changed files.

What I have done:

1) Extracted all the encoded binaries that I was able to locate out of the original 
source sets.
2) For the ones that were not extractable for errors, I put a placeholder text file
for that entry.
3) If an encoding was an archive that was not ZIP, I converted it to ZIP.  If an
encoding was not a ZIP file, I zipped them.  If there was more than one file, they were
zipped together.
4) Renamed all the ZIP files to match the file they were gotten from.  If ICON.ZIP was 
decoded from 0300.PAS, it got renamed to 0300.ICON.ZIP.
5) All encodings were deleted from the PAS files.  In their place a message was placed
stating to download the attached file for it.
6) All encodings were deleted from the HTML files.  In their place a message was placed
stating to download the attached file for it.  Also, a link was placed in the header and
footer labeled "Attachment" so the user could download the decoded file.  If the particular
file had an error in decoding, a link was set to a page explaining the issue and requesting
the binary file be provided.
7) All PAS.ZIP files were updated with the changes.  If 0300.PAS.ZIP had 0300.PAS & FILE_ID.DIZ,
it now has the changed 0300.PAS, FILE_ID.DIZ, and 0300.ICON.ZIP.
8) Added a link on the "Attachment removed" message.

The following files had encoding errors:

DELPHI
------
0317.PAS - MWSORT.ZIP

WIN-OS2
------
0036.PAS - OWNLIST.RES
